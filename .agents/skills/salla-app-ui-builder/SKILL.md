# Salla App Store Listing Page (`app_page_builder`)

The **listing page** is the app's **home/landing page** shown to merchants on the App Store and when they install it. It is an **ordered list of blocks** (App Information, Features, Reviews, Brands, FAQ, Stats — revealed dynamically by `init` / `catalog`), authored entirely through the **`app_page_builder`** MCP tool — there is no REST endpoint or token to handle. Drive listing-page work through `app_page_builder` and `salla_upload`.

Editing a block's element values **writes the shared listing content directly into the app's draft publication**. The fields this tool owns: **`name`, `description`, `logo`, `screenshots`, `benefits`** (value shapes in [blocks-and-fields.md](references/blocks-and-fields.md#the-shared-listing-fields)).

> **`short_description` belongs elsewhere** — it lives in the publication's `basic_information` section (50–200 chars) and is written via `app_publish` → **salla-publication-consistency**. Author it there, not here.

## Prerequisite: open a draft first

`app_page_builder` is enabled once the app is public and has a draft publication. Create the draft first:

```
app_publish action=open
```

The publish/draft lifecycle (open, fill the publication sections, validate + save the draft, then the partner submits in the Portal) is owned by **salla-publication-consistency** — read that skill for the full flow. `app_page_builder` writes the shared listing content into the draft once it exists.

## The 9 actions

All calls take `action=` (and the app context the MCP already holds). Discover shapes with the read actions (`catalog`, `list`, `show`) before writing.

**Typical flow:** `app_publish action=open` → `app_page_builder action=init` (seed required blocks) → `action=list` → `action=show` (per block, to learn its element keys) → `action=set` (write values) → `action=add`/`remove`/`sort` as needed.

The full action contract (parameters, returns, errors) is in [api-spec.md](references/api-spec.md).

## Media (logo, screenshots)

Image elements (`logo`, `screenshots`) reference an uploaded media id:

1. `salla_upload` with a `source_url` → returns an integer image **`id`**.
2. Put `[{ id, url }]` in that element's `set` value.

Keep an existing image by leaving its stored `{ id, url }` in place when you `set`.

## Generating missing listing images (canonical recipe)

This is the shared recipe every listing/publication image field points to. It covers **all**
the App-Store image fields across the builder, the publication, and the embedded app:

| Image field      | Set via                            | Required?               | Dimensions / limit                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `logo` (icon)    | `app_page_builder` App Information | Required                | 1:1, ≥ 250×250 px; JPG/JPEG/PNG                     |
| `screenshots`    | `app_page_builder` App Information | Required, **≥ 3**       | 263×350 px each; multiple                           |
| benefit images   | `app_page_builder` App Features    | Required, **exactly 3** | per the `benefits.image` field (confirm via `show`) |
| `banner`         | `app_publish` features section     | Optional                | image file (no enforced dimensions)                 |
| `embedded_image` | `app_publish` features section     | Embedded apps only      | min 710×260 px (recommended 1420×520), max 512 KB   |

> Dimensions and counts above (logo 1:1 ≥250×250, ≥3 screenshots, exactly 3 benefits) are
> **enforced server-side on save** — `action=set` returns `error.fields` if they're off. Confirm
> the live requirement for a builder field via `app_page_builder action=show` rather than treating
> these numbers as builder-FE guarantees.
>
> `banner` and `embedded_image` are **publication** fields, not builder fields — set them via
> `app_publish` (**salla-publication-consistency**); `embedded_image` is the Embedded App
> Banner and applies only when the app has an iframe page (**salla-embedded-app**, which also
> owns the second Salla-promotional image). `logo` is also set at app creation
> (**salla-app-builder** Step 1).

When any of these is missing — or you're assembling the **first** publication — **and an
image-generation tool is available to you**, generate an image that fits the app's purpose and
brand, then upload and set it:

1. **Confirm the required dimensions/aspect first** for that field from the table above (and
   `action=catalog` / `action=show` / [blocks-and-fields.md](references/blocks-and-fields.md)
   for builder fields) — so the upload isn't rejected.
2. **Generate** the image at that size to match the app.
3. **Upload** it with `salla_upload` → returns the image `id`.
4. **Set** it via the field's tool: builder fields (`logo`, `screenshots`, benefit images) via
   `app_page_builder`; `banner` / `embedded_image` via `app_publish` features section.

## Listing images must be real — ask first, placeholder only with a heads-up

A complete listing needs **real** images: `logo` + **≥3 screenshots** (App Information),
`banner` + `embedded_image` (App Features, per the table above). The discipline when any are
missing:

1. **Ask the user to provide all the required images.** Don't invent a real-looking image
   and don't silently skip a field — this is verify-don't-invent. (If an image-generation
   tool is available and the user wants generated art, use the generate-then-upload recipe
   above.)
2. **If the user skips or declines, proceed with clearly-marked default placeholders** so the
   draft still validates — then **explicitly tell the partner to replace the placeholders in
   the Portal before the one-click submit** (the submit step → salla-publication-consistency).
   Never present a placeholder image as final.

**Gate:** "Every listing image is a real partner asset — or a placeholder the partner has
been explicitly told to replace before submitting?"

## Auto-fill: the default template

A published app already has a listing page: the default template renders from publication data. `app_page_builder` writes into that **same draft**, so partial customization mixes with the default template.

## The model

- An **app's listing** = the ordered array of blocks returned by `action=list`.
- The **catalog** (`action=catalog`) is the full set of block types you can `add`.
- A block carries `id`, `slug`, `order`, and the flags `is_required`, `editable`, `is_visible`; its editable inputs are **elements** (key → value), discovered via `action=show`.
- `app-information` is the one pinned block — `init` seeds it and `remove` rejects it. The remaining required/optional blocks are revealed dynamically by `init` / `catalog`; confirm the live set at call time.

See [Blocks and Fields](references/blocks-and-fields.md) for the block/element model and how to discover types and element keys, [API spec](references/api-spec.md) for the action contract, and [Payloads](references/payloads.md) for `set` value shapes. Example block ids and element keys are **illustrative** — confirm them with `action=catalog` / `action=show`.

## Things to keep in mind

> - **Run `init` first** on a fresh draft — it seeds the required blocks and returns the current page.
> - **Confirm ids and keys at call time** with `action=catalog` (block types) and `action=show` (element keys); example ids/keys in this skill are illustrative.
> - **App Information is the one pinned block** — always present, stays first, can't be removed. The rest of the required/optional blocks are revealed by `init` / `catalog` (slugs illustrative — confirm at call time). **App Plans always renders on the listing as a placeholder** (even when the app has no plans) — but it's **not an editable builder block**; populate it via the publish flow's pricing step → salla-publication-consistency / salla-app-billing.
> - **Contact details** live in the publication's **`contact_information`** section → salla-publication-consistency. Some support/contact channels may also surface on App Information as flat `support_*` elements — confirm with `action=show`.
> - **Lingual elements** carry both Arabic and English (`{ "ar": "…", "en": "…" }`).
> - **Collection** element children are keyed with the collection id as a prefix (`features.title`). See [payloads.md](references/payloads.md).
> - **`image` and `richtext` values render as public App-Store content** — use only trusted, sanitized assets/HTML.

## Red Flags

| Tempting thought                                                            | Why it's wrong                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "No logo/screenshot given — I'll generate a real-looking one and ship it."  | That invents an asset the partner never approved. Ask the user for the real images first (verify-don't-invent).                        |
| "The user didn't provide images, so I'll drop in placeholders and move on." | Placeholders are fine **only** if you mark them clearly and tell the partner to replace them in the Portal before they submit.         |
| "I'll quietly skip the missing image so readiness passes."                  | Silently shipping a placeholder as final is the failure. The partner must know which images are stand-ins before the one-click submit. |
